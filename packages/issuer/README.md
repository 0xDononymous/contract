# Dononymous KYC Credential Issuer

This folder contains a app that acts as a KYC credential issuer. Currently, we're issuing wallets with valid Lens handles Polygon ID self-sovereign credentials. 
We do not store or have access to your lens profile information once the credential is issued to you. Your data & privacy remain 100%  yours.

One can use this verified credential to access the **Dononymous main app** without disclosing any personal info!

## Getting Started

- Run the application by entering `yarn dev` and navigate to the URL provided (if you're running from the root folder, use `yarn --cwd packages/issuer dev` instead.)
